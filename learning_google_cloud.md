# Basics

Terms:

  * Project -- can not create resources that span projects. In some cases you can create shared resource...
  * Zone -- 2+ data centers co-located, likely closely enough. 1ms round trip. Independent failure domain
  * Region -- geographic area, 2 or more zones seperated by tens of miles. 5ms latency
  * Project ID -- globaly unique (Google will _make_ / preview this unique when you create a project name)

# Cloud Console

https://console.cloud.google.com


# Cloud IAM


domain / organization -> folders -> roles -> principles (the humans)

includes default service accounts as starting point / best practice!

## Roles

Viewer
Editor <-- edit stuff
Owner <-- modify privs

(these are not great from a least priviledged aspect, but they're an AppEngine thing that came forward)

this is on the test!

## Service Accounts

right there in the IAM sidebar

# Cloud SDK

# Tools

Cloud Shell Editor <-- ?? "more like an IDE" ???
Cloud Shell  <-- CLI and this is authed based on the project you're logged into. BUT is persistent!

# Monitoring

"Cloud Monitoring": formerly known as "StackDriver" (used to be a third party company, not acquired)

## Billing

Can do billing data -> bigquery so can SQL QUERY FOR IT!!!!

# Networking


## VPC

Global resource!!!!!

Elements:

  * default     <-- created for you. Probably don't want this b/c you don't control this
  * automode    <-- can not connect to other VPCs with VPC peering, allows traffic from subnets and to/from internet. (Uggh)
  * custom mode <-- define CIDR blocks, define firewall rules to open up just what you need
  * Subnets
  * Routes
  * Firewall rules (ingest, egress)
  * VPC flow logging
  * VPC peering
  * shared VPC <-- lets you share VPCs with other project


automode VPC - includes

# Pub Sub

From [Cloud Pub/Sub Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview)

> Pub/Sub enables you to create systems of event producers and consumers, called publishers and subscribers. Publishers communicate with subscribers asynchronously by broadcasting events, rather than by synchronous remote procedure calls (RPCs).

> Pub/Sub adopts from messaging middleware is per-message parallelism (rather than partition-based). Pub/Sub "leases" individual messages to subscriber clients, then keeps track of whether a given message has been successfully processed.



## Core concepts

  * Topic
  * Subscription
  * Message
  * Message Attribute <-- Messages are k/v pairs a publisher can define
  * ACK <-- signal sent by a subscriber after it has successfully retrieved (? and processed?) the message

Messages pushed out to all subscribers in Cloud Pub/Sub AT LEAST once. (aka: yes a subscriber does not pull from a consumer group / partition, essentially each subscription is its own stream)

Delivery methods:

  * Push <-- each message goes to a subscriber defined endpoint
  * Pull <-- your application asks for next message

## The Java SDK specifically

### Subscribing to a pull topic

```java
  Subscriber.newBuilder( ProjectSubscriptionName.of(myProjectName, aSubscriptionId),
    MessageReciever_AFunctorClassWhichReallyShouldHaveBeenOneOfTheFunctionalInterfacesButIsNotBarely)
    .setParallelPullCount(4)
    .setExectorProvider(...) // thread executor goes here s
```

#### the executor provider

is of interface type `com.google.api.gax.core.ExecutorProvider` which seems to be implemented only one place `InstantiatingExectorProvider` which seems to be really a java `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`.
