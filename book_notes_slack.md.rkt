The people that set the schedule, not just the ones tht fail to meet it, need to be held accountable... Forcing a project unto an unrealistic schedule is dangerous for the company and has to be made dangerous as well for those that impose the schedule.

    Think about it this way: 20% is a good _tip_ at a diner. Or another way: 5 percent is less than sales tax. Real world examples - or prices - typically have a variant from published to what you actually pay, of > 5 percent!!!

The rule is (as with children) that trust be given slightly in advance of demonstrated trustworthiness. But not too much in advance. You have to have an unerring sense of how much the person is ready for. Setting people up for failure doesn't ake them loyal to you; you have to set them up for success.

The key role of middle-management is reinention....

If the essential task of middle management is reinention, when is that task being carried out? The answer is, during time that is not used up direting the day to day business....

	#:original-highlight "Companies that are succeeding have very little status. For example, the entire concept of 'production' is going away. Production implies a steady state. In its place we find a state of almost constant flux. The new central organizing principles is the project. A company in this kind of flux can be viewed as a portfolio of projects. Each project seems to effect some change."
	] {
At the org level: Very little status quo, but little slack to deal with changes the 'new new new way to do things' has brought to the organization??!!

At the project level: little slack at the project level means it's hard to get perspective time to (a) reflect on the work or business processes you've created (b) improve same (c) improve ie technical debt of the project or across teams.

Ideally ownership of a process is pushed downward. Instead of being a corporate asset, it is a team asset

To establish a stardarized way of doing any knowledge task, you end up focusing on the mechanics of the task. But the mechanics are a small and typically not very important portion of the whole. How the work goes on inside the nodes of the worker diagram is not so nearly important as how wide and rich the connections.

These steps often include items I have identified as barriers to change, such as reduced slack, standard process, poured-in-concrete processes and voluminous documentation of everything that will hold still for it...

Slack is the lubricant that makes all these things possible. Vision and leadership, in particular, depend on degrees of freedom made available to the potential visionary or leader.

It's a much more insidioous kind of fear that interferes with change: the fear of mockery. If you want to make change in your organiziation utterly _impossible_, try mocking people s they struggle with the new unfamiliar way you have just urged upon them. There is no surer way to stop esential change dead.

The safety that is required for essential change is a sure sense that no one will be mocked, demeaned or belittled while strugling to ahiee mastery.

Training = practice by doing a new task much more slowly than an expert would do it

... Any so called training experience that lacks the slow-down characteristic is an exercise in non-learning.

Most corporate trainings fit easily into this category. You are given an input-only stage in which you ingest some new idea or approach, and then a performance stage in which you practice it. Only you don't get to practice it at a tenth the speed (or even nine-tenths the speed) that an expert would do it.

There is no training without an extended period of practicing at a much slower than expert rate. In today's Hurry Up corporation that usually means there is no training.
