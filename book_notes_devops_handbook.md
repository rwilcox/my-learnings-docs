# My Notes


> High performers deployed code thirty times more frequently, and the time required to go from “code committed” to “successfully running in production” was two hundred times faster— high performers had lead times measured in minutes or hours, while low performers had lead times measured in weeks, months, or even quarters.

> In DevOps, we typically define our technology value stream as the process required to convert a business hypothesis into a technology-enabled service that delivers value to the customer.

> The First Way enables fast left-to-right flow of work from Development to Operations to the customer. In order to maximize flow, we need to make work visible, reduce our batch sizes and intervals of work, build in quality by preventing defects from being passed to downstream work centers, and constantly optimize for the global goals.

> The Second Way enables the fast and constant flow of feedback from right to left at all stages of our value stream. It requires that we amplify feedback to prevent problems from happening again, or enable faster detection and recovery.

> The Third Way enables the creation of a generative, high-trust culture that supports a dynamic, disciplined and scientific approach to experimentation and risk-taking, facilitating the creation of organizational learning, both from our successes and failures

> designing perfectly safe systems is likely beyond our abilities, but we can make it safer to work in complex systems when the four following conditions are met:
> 1. Complex work is managed so that problems in design and operations are revealed
> 2. Problems are swarmed and solved, resulting in quick construction of new knowledge
> 3. New local knowledge is exploited globally throughout the organization
> 4. Leaders create other leaders who continually grow these types of capabilities
