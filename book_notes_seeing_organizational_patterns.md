# Book summary

The way an organization behaves can be broken into a [project mangement triangle](https://asana.com/resources/project-management-triangle) type set of constraints.

These constraints are:

  * cooperation
  * control
  * autonomy

[Seeing Organizational Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Organizational-Patterns-Robert-Keidel-dp-1881052656/dp/1881052656/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1631037159)



> [The director of training for a major industrial corporation was committed to helper move her firm from an authoritative style of decision making to one that was more collaborative] It soon become clear that certain issues were unresolvable except by fiat. At the same time, other decisions concerned individual matterns that had nothing to do with the department.

> Reastically professional's work does call for autonomy, large scale manufacturing does demand control, and teamwork does depend on cooperation. But each of these situations - like most organizational problems - require that all three variables be taken into account.

> Organizations are inherently triadick because there are only three ways in which people can related, without conflict, to each other - patterns that correspond to the three code design variables identified above: autonomy, control and cooperation.

> **Autonomy vs control** is the classic field versus headquarters dilemna: nitty gritty verse big picture. Those in the field are "where the rubber meets the road" as the famous tire commercial used to put it. They are in touch with customer needs and geographic nuances in a way that remote corporate managers and staffers can rarely be. What field personal tend to lack, however, is a view of the whole.
> **Control vs cooperation** is tantamount to consistency vs innovation.
> **Autonomy vs cooperation** is equivalent to accountability vs synergy - indivdual vs the goup. The more an organization stresses individual or unit accountablity, the less likely it is to benefit fom spontaneous cooperation amoung individuals or units. Conversely, the greater the commitment to synergy, the more difficult it is to sort out each player's contribution.

> Three ways to fail. Managersand organizations can fail in any of three general ways:
>   
> * by overdoing their top priority - whether it be autonomy or control or cooperation.
>   
> * By under-doing their bottom priority
>   
> * By operating without priorities.

> Many self styled "process consultants" continue to encourage organizational teams to reach virtually every decision in a collaborative manner. Such an ambition is unrealizable. In any social system some decisions will always have to be mandated, while others will have to be delegated to specific individuals.

> Two variable design comes in two varities: (1) those that seek a compromise or tradeoff between two variables and (2) those that try to combine or maximize two variables. The former believe that increasing one variable neccisarily decreases the other; they live in a shades of gray world.
> The latter are convinced that both varibles can be maximized without having to trade off anything; they live in a world of black and white.

> **Underdoing autonomy** During the past two decades in the United Status, much of what has passed for quality of worklife, employee involvement, and Japanesse management techniques has attemped to counterbalance control with cooperation, but with virtually no attention to autonomy.

> **Underdoing cooperation**
> Most corporate managers that I have observed percieve organizational design as linear - reducable to a continum of centralization (control) at one end and desentralization (autonomy) at the other, with teamwork (cooperation) nowhere in site. The firm, like a trolley, goes back and forth between the two extremes. "Things have become too bureaucratic we need to drive decision making down to those who are where the action is", or "things have gotten out of hand; we need to concentrate authority where we have the big picture"

> Effective three varible thinking does not mean maximizing all three variables. Rather it means emphasizing one or two variables, ithout negeting any. Any organization that tries to maximize all three patterns will likely lose any sense of priorities.

> Corporate planner Peter Schwartz explains why he favors triads when constructing future scenarios. "... people's minds can cope with only two or three possibilities. Two may not capture reality, so you can use thre. On rare occasions you might consider four. Any more choices will produce a hopeless muddle"
>

> Note that matrix organization is depicted as stuck in the middle of the triangle. Matrix designs typically try to combine an input (control) bias and an output (autonomy) bias by requiring certain managers to report to both an input (for example, functional) boss and an output (product/market) boss. But to make this combination work, considerable volentary oooperation among all parties is essentian; without quesion, the absense of such cooperation has sunk many a matrix.

> There are, to be sure, successful examples of matrix organizations and dual-reporting relationships can work so log as autonomy, control and cooperation are carefully prioritized. Still, maintaining a matrix is one tough act - especially long term.

> In their classic book, _Organization and Envinonment_, Paul Lawernce and Jay Lorsch define _differentiation_ as "the difference in cognitive and emotional orientation amnong managers in different functional departments."

> At this point, I introduced a triad that had been useful in several other contexts; motivations for middle management change. I suggested that, initially, skeptical managers are likely to go along with change (to the extent that they do so at all) primarily for political reasons  because such behavior is "expected" by their boss (and pay the promotional opportunities may hang in the balance).After having come on board for political reasons, such individuals may later support organizational change initiatives for peformance reasons - because they have seen successful examples  and believe "it works". The third stage is to embrace cooperative change for personal reasons - because it "is right". the mistake a lot of senior management make is unrealistically to expect early commitment by thei subordinate managers for personal reasons. It is often sensible to start with political / performance postures and then encourage the humanistic aspect of change motivation to deevlop over time.

 ## Organizational strategy


> Organizational strategy answers three fundimental questions (1) _why_ an organization exists (2) _what_ it is (3) _how_ it competes.
> 
> - From Seeing Organizational Patterns by Keidel on page 49 ()


> Character is defined in part by cultural bias - that is, by the overriding social values of the organization. It is also defined by mutal expectations; what the organization expects from its people, and what the people in turn expect from their organization. Finally character is expressed in terms of an organization's development pattern - the manner in which it grows, develops and renews itself

> employees/cooperation
> shareholders/subsidizers (control)
> customers / clients (autonomy)

> In the opinion of CalTech president Thomas E Everhart, "one outstandig scientist can do 100 or 1,000 times more good than someone who is almost as good"

> - From Seeing Organizational Patterns by Keidel on page 59 ()


> A concluding note: _Organizational Strategy_ defines purpose, vision, mission, raison de d'etre. Although the framework presenter here is idealized - and therefore vasily oversimplified - it does enable serios dialog about choices. Too often, corporate purpose is dismissed as something like "the vision thing". But unless an organization periodically thinks through issues of consituencies, character and capabiliies - why we exist, how we exist and how we satisy customers - the odds are strong it will lose direction and flounder, no matter how rigorously it addreses atters of structure and systems.
