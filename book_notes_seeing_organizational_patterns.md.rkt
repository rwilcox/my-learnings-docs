**Autonomy vs control** is the classic field versus headquarters dilemna: nitty gritty verse big picture. Those in the field are "where the rubber meets the road" as the famous tire commercial used to put it. They are in touch with customer needs and geographic nuances in a way that remote corporate managers and staffers can rarely be. What field personal tend to lack, however, is a view of the whole.

**Control vs cooperation** is tantamount to consistency vs innovation.

**Autonomy vs cooperation** is equivalent to accountability vs synergy - indivdual vs the goup. The more an organization stresses individual or unit accountablity, the less likely it is to benefit fom spontaneous cooperation amoung individuals or units. Conversely, the greater the commitment to synergy, the more difficult it is to sort out each player's contribution.}

Three ways to fail. Managersand organizations can fail in any of three general ways:

  * by overdoing their top priority - whether it be autonomy or control or cooperation.
  * By under-doing their bottom priority
  * By operating without priorities.

Many self styled "process consultants" continue to encourage organizational teams to reach virtually every decision in a collaborative manner. Such an ambition is unrealizable. In any social system some decisions will always have to be mandated, while others will have to be delegated to specific individuals.

                          Two variable design comes in two varities: (1) those that seek a compromise or tradeoff between two variables and (2) those that try to combine or maximize two variables. The former believe that increasing one variable neccisarily decreases the other; they live in a shades of gray world.

                          The latter are convinced that both varibles can be maximized without having to trade off anything; they live in a world of black and white.}

**Underdoing autonomy** During the past two decades in the United Status, much of what has passed for quality of worklife, employee involvement, and Japanesse management techniques has attemped to counterbalance control with cooperation, but with virtually no attention to autonomy.

**Underdoing cooperation**

Most corporate managers that I have observed percieve organizational design as linear - reducable to a continum of centralization (control) at one end and desentralization (autonomy) at the other, with teamwork (cooperation) nowhere in site. The firm, like a trolley, goes back and forth between the two extremes. "Things have become too bureaucratic we need to drive decision making down to those who are where the action is", or "things have gotten out of hand; we need to concentrate authority where we have the big picture"

 Effective three varible thinking does not mean maximizing all three variables. Rather it means emphasizing one or two variables, ithout negeting any. Any organization that tries to maximize all three patterns will likely lose any sense of priorities.}

Corporate planner Peter Schwartz explains why he favors triads when constructing future scenarios. "... people's minds can cope with only two or three possibilities. Two may not capture reality, so you can use thre. On rare occasions you might consider four. Any more choices will produce a hopeless muddle"}
