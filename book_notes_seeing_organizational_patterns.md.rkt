The way an organization behaves can be broken into a [project mangement triangle](https://asana.com/resources/project-management-triangle) type set of constraints.

These constraints are:

  * cooperation
  * control
  * autonomy

**Autonomy vs control** is the classic field versus headquarters dilemna: nitty gritty verse big picture. Those in the field are "where the rubber meets the road" as the famous tire commercial used to put it. They are in touch with customer needs and geographic nuances in a way that remote corporate managers and staffers can rarely be. What field personal tend to lack, however, is a view of the whole.

**Control vs cooperation** is tantamount to consistency vs innovation.

**Autonomy vs cooperation** is equivalent to accountability vs synergy - indivdual vs the goup. The more an organization stresses individual or unit accountablity, the less likely it is to benefit fom spontaneous cooperation amoung individuals or units. Conversely, the greater the commitment to synergy, the more difficult it is to sort out each player's contribution.}

Three ways to fail. Managersand organizations can fail in any of three general ways:

  * by overdoing their top priority - whether it be autonomy or control or cooperation.
  * By under-doing their bottom priority
  * By operating without priorities.

                          Two variable design comes in two varities: (1) those that seek a compromise or tradeoff between two variables and (2) those that try to combine or maximize two variables. The former believe that increasing one variable neccisarily decreases the other; they live in a shades of gray world.

                          The latter are convinced that both varibles can be maximized without having to trade off anything; they live in a world of black and white.}

**Underdoing cooperation**

Most corporate managers that I have observed percieve organizational design as linear - reducable to a continum of centralization (control) at one end and desentralization (autonomy) at the other, with teamwork (cooperation) nowhere in site. The firm, like a trolley, goes back and forth between the two extremes. "Things have become too bureaucratic we need to drive decision making down to those who are where the action is", or "things have gotten out of hand; we need to concentrate authority where we have the big picture"

Note that matrix organization is depicted as stuck in the middle of the triangle. Matrix designs typically try to combine an input (control) bias and an output (autonomy) bias by requiring certain managers to report to both an input (for example, functional) boss and an output (product/market) boss. But to make this combination work, considerable volentary oooperation among all parties is essentian; without quesion, the absense of such cooperation has sunk many a matrix.}

There are, to be sure, successful examples of matrix organizations and dual-reporting relationships can work so log as autonomy, control and cooperation are carefully prioritized. Still, maintaining a matrix is one tough act - especially long term.

 At this point, I introduced a triad that had been useful in several other contexts; motivations for middle management change. I suggested that, initially, skeptical managers are likely to go along with change (to the extent that they do so at all) primarily for political reasons  because such behavior is "expected" by their boss (and pay the promotional opportunities may hang in the balance).After having come on board for political reasons, such individuals may later support organizational change initiatives for peformance reasons - because they have seen successful examples  and believe "it works". The third stage is to embrace cooperative change for personal reasons - because it "is right". the mistake a lot of senior management make is unrealistically to expect early commitment by thei subordinate managers for personal reasons. It is often sensible to start with political / performance postures and then encourage the humanistic aspect of change motivation to deevlop over time.}

A concluding note: _Organizational Strategy_ defines purpose, vision, mission, raison de d'etre. Although the framework presenter here is idealized - and therefore vasily oversimplified - it does enable serios dialog about choices. Too often, corporate purpose is dismissed as something like "the vision thing". But unless an organization periodically thinks through issues of consituencies, character and capabiliies - why we exist, how we exist and how we satisy customers - the odds are strong it will lose direction and flounder, no matter how rigorously it addreses atters of structure and systems.}

A traffic circle is a space in which so many people interact so often that almost everyone becomes overwhelmed. The effect isa similar to that in an actual traffic circle (rotary), where there is no legal right of way: Cars and trucks continuously cut each other off as they enter and exit. Virtually any organizational unit can degenerate into a traffic circle-if it attracts enough commerce from enough directions. This pattern is particularly evident in departments (or locations) that are lodged between two or more other departments that need to work together closely; the in-between zone becomes inundated from both (all) ends.

Pivotal interdependence features one central individual or unit
around whom (or which) others interact. It is exemplified by a classic
offensive pattern in basketball, in which the center acts as a pivot by
receiving the ball from, and passing it to, the other players as they cut

"Pure" Modes of Decision-Making

There are six viable ways to make a decision-three "pure" and three mixed- and four nonviable modes. The "pure" patterns and their flawed extremes will be discussed first.

To delegate a decision is to permit one or more subordinates to decide within boundaries set by the manager. Delegation is a form of empowerment that has three strengths:
  1. It moves authority close to the action- real-time, real-place
  2. it increases subordinates' ship of the decision; and
  3. it frees up the delegator's time for more strategic decision-making.

To mandate a decision is to make the call unilaterally. When a manager mandates, she or he usually brings to bear a global perspective--the big picture. And mandating is easy to do since no one else is involved in the process.

The downside of a global perspective is an insensitivity to local conditions the nitty-gritty. And the price of an easy decision-making process is that those left to implement the decision may lack energy. Few people feel ownership of a decision when they have played no part in arriving at that decision.

To dictate is to impose orders what to do/how to do it-without explaining why, and without concern for subordinates' reactions.
