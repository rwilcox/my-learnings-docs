# Performance

  * https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1216492121198215168?s=21 — what DO you ask if traditional quarterly / bi-yearly / yearly reviews are no good?

# Customer Frustrations:
  * "what do you mean you don't know how much it will cost?!?"
  * "what do you know, you don't know when it'll be done?"

# Team Size <<Managing_Agile_Team_Size>>

Rule of thumb is "two pizza team" or "6 +/- 3"

**BUT**, to quote scrum guide:

>  The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.

So, a cross-functional example team:

  * Scrum Master (A)
  * Product Owner  (B)
  * BA (C)
  * Project Manager ?
  * 1: QA (D)
  * 1: mobile (E)
  * 1: web (F)
  * 1: backend (G)
  * 1: backend (H)
  * 1: mobile (I)
  * 1: web (J)
  * 1: backend (K)

If you include the SM+PO+BA you onlf get down to _maybe_ H. But that leaves you with:

  * no backups
  * still a very small team

With say 3 of each part of the stack you both have backups, some ability for a developer to be shown as a leader across the team (or sneak into other areas in the stack).

It's not a great, but compare the two teams when you include the SM/PO in the work.

(Now yes, I do believe that the POs work should be visible on the board for others to see - downwards transparency - but not estimated, because only one person knows the work, vs 2-3).

(But this is around 12? people at the larger extreme.)

## Problems with too small of a team

  * expecting everyone to perform tasks equally well
  * if they don't likelihood of very small silos happening ("oh, I didn't get too much into their work at a practical level, because I don't really understand Typescript, and they don't really understand Java. We mostly just checkboxed each others PRs at a good enough level, but if you want me to actually write some Typescript ummmmm....")
  * what happens if even 1 person goes on long term leave, or quits (ie paternity / maternity leave)
  * where is developer's ability to grow / lead in the small / in the team? Especially with orgs that say "we want to see you performing at the level required for your new role for 6-12 months before we give it to you". (_is_ that possible in your teams?)
  * Slack time and time for individual developer growth goes down (because a developer with a 20% task means the cross-functional team's velocity is down 10%, if there's two developers on the team)
  * Q: what about bleedy individuals, whose efforts bleed into other teams? PO/SM will feel like they don't have velocity to spare _but_ this person is likely helping out the project and or organization by being glue

# dual people roles

## dual roles that might work

### developers that are architects

  (?)

### managers that write code sometimes

boy howdy this is hard. In one way see Managers_Writing_Code. on the other hand, you can’t work on something critical path and you also can’t be inthe situation where people are afraid to code review your code as well as it should be because you’re the boss (power imbalance!!). 

On the judging hand, a [Gemba walk](https://kanbanize.com/lean-management/improvement/gemba-walk/) is a thing. Or a Gemba pair programming session: let your developer drive and DON’T say anything. Or, don’t ask questions about the code / design, as questions around the environment they work on: the code is almost a discardable artifact in this type of scenario. (But it might not be enough? Or you may Peter Principle this(?) so careful(?). )

On the fourth hand, there’a a difference between managing 3 people and 7 people and 12 people..

<<Dual_Roles_That_Might_Work_Manager_Developer>>

## dual roles that don’t work

### Tech leads that are scrum masters or even coaches <<Dual_Roles_That_Do_Not_Work_Dev_Coach>>

  it may be hard for others outside the team to know if you are being a cranky developer or if you are representing a legit team complaint.

 *  Your_Agile_Coach_Should_Not_Be_A_Developer

### People managers that are architects

can be too far away from day to day code bits; means design could "win" by default; splits focus; might tramble on actual architects without org chart power if you say need > 1 for your team, or > 1 people manager for your team because team is so large ( / middle manager overconfidence). 

Are you winning because your idea is the best / actually viable, or are people falling into trap of Highrst Paid Person’s Opinion?
