# And building a mindset to handle that change

William Bridges Transition Model - book _Managing Transitions (making the most of change)_

VUCA - Volitile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous

## Stage 1: Ending / letting go

Can interact with stages of grief

## Stage 2: "Neutral Zone"

ambiguuty of this stage gets our inner critic going with thoughts like:

  * why can't I get it together?
  * it's too hard
  * This is just not working

it's likely not the change people fear, but the uncertainity and disruptions to normalcy.

even though it is uncomfortable, don't rush through this stage

Adjust expectations around productivity; create temporary solutions to the temporary problems found in the Neutral Zone

Feeling stuck? Don't fester, use avaliable resources
Experiment and innovate

Q: What helps you stay centered?

(7 habits of highly effective people)

## Stage 3: Timing

New skills are being built
Early wins occuring
Energy is high
renewed commitment (to keep things going)

sometimes retreating into stage 1 and 2

The four Ps:
  * purpose
  * picture of how outcome should look / feel
  * plan
  * ask for / propose a PART to play in both the plan and in the outcome


Ambiguuty calls for adaptive approach:

technical solution:
  * solution is known
  * solution is supported by existing mindset, structures and procedures
  * creating an implementing solutions requires informational learning

adaptive challenge:
  * solution is not known
  * solution requires overhauling existing mindset (priorities, beliefs, behaviors, loyalitis)
  * defining, creating, implementing solution requires transformational learning

navigating ambiguuty supports increasing our mental complexity

socalized mind -> self authoring mind -> self transforming mind
