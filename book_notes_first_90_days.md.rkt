Too often, however, the new leader behaves more like a virus: her early actions alienate potential supporters, undermine her credability and stimulate defensive reactions. As a vicious cycle takes hold the organization's immune system gets activated and the new leader is attacked by clumps of killer cells, encapsulated and finally expelled.

Conceptual backbone of the road map is a ten key transition challege:

  1. Promote yourself
  2. Accelerate your learning
  3. Match strategy to situation (you need to diagnose the business situation accurately and clarfiy its challenges and opportunities)
  4. Secure early wins (Early wins buid your credability and create momenteum)
  5. Negotiate success (you need to figure out how to have a productive working relationship with your new boss and manage his/her expectations. This means carefully planning for a series of critical conversations about the situation, expectations, style, resources and personal development.
  6. Achieve alignment (The higher your rise in an org the more you have to play the role of organizational architect)
  7. Build your team
  8. Create coalations (Your success will depend on your ability to influence people outside of your direct line of control)
  9. Keep your balance
  10. Expidite everyone

A related mistake is to believe that you will be successful in your new job by contineing to do what you did in your previous job, only more so. This thinking is destructive because doing what you know how to do and avoiding what you don't can appear to work, at least for a while

Securing early wins

But what is a win differs drastically among the four situations. 

  * In a start-up, getting the right team in place an achieving strategic focus are key wins.
  * In turnarounds, getting the right team in place is also a potential early win, as idenfitying the defendable core of the business and making major progress in paring the organization back up to it. 
  * In realignments, gaining acceptance of the need for change and instilling a sense of urgency are often big wins
  * in sustaining success situations, gaining and displayin understanding of what has made the organization successful is a key early win, because it helps you win the right to make decisions about the organization's future.}
