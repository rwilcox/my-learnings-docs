    FOO=${FOO:-default_val_here}

or

    : ${FOO:=default_val_here}

## `${}` vs `$() vs backticks`

`$()` == two backticks. This is command substitution. [Source](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/165637/193798)

`${}` does the following things:

  1. expand variable `${varHere}` <-- varHere
  2. expanding array elements, as in ${array[42]}
  3. using parameter expansion operations, as in ${filename%.*} (remove extension)
  4. expanding positional parameters beyond 9: "$8 $9 ${10} ${11}"

## globs

### replicating zsh double-star glob

[zsh documentation about this](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Recursive-Globbing)

While bash has this functionality (in the last decade...), `ash` seems to not?

`find $1 -name '*.txt' | grep '.txt' > /dev/null` <-- gives you a 0 if files found, a 1 if no files found

  * apparently this is a feature of Bash 4 (2010-ish)? see (this SO answer)[https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/197382/193798]

# <<Learning_Ops_Unix_Bash_Interactively>>

    $ r -1 # re-executes the last command you entered
    $ r -1 | vi # â€¦ yup, piping works here too

    $ !-1  # fills in your next command prompt with your previously executed command (you typoed it or whatever)
    $ sudo !-1 # your previous command now has sudo prepended! (thanks Sam!)
    $ !sudo     # runs the last command that started with sudo (thanks Nicholas!)

    $ $_ # executes the result of the previous command (Thanks, Adam!)

# <<Learning_Ops_Unix_STD_AS_File>>

STDOUT, STDERR, STDIN are files too.

Some programs need you to specify `-` as a parameter if you are passing stdin into the program. NO MORE!!

    $ ls | diff /dev/fd/stdout my_old_listing

# <<Learning_Ops_Unix_Process_Substitution>>

Q: what if you need to pipe the STDOUT of multiple commands? or send the output of a command into another command that doesn't support stdin (and you don't want to use `/dev/fd/stdout`)?

(At implementation level uses fd (file descriptors) in supported OSes, else uses named pipes.)

    diff <(ls my_dir)>  <(ls some_other_dir)>
